# Georgia-Ukraine-War
 Why Georgia sides with Russia in the Ukraine war - In 2008 Georgia faced an invasion by Russia in a war with striking similarity to the present invasion of Ukraine. Since then one-fifth of the country is occupied by Russian troops. Russia's president Vladimir Putin left no doubt that he fully intends to annex the former soviet state next. The invasion of Georgia was stopped due to an intervention by the presidents of Ukraine and USA. Yet, in the present war Georgia has not sided with the Ukraine claiming that a participation of international sanctions would lead to economic and social collapse. Is this true or is the acting Georgian government just a puppet regime in the pocket of Vladimir Putin? This private data science projects will shed light into this question.
